          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash is an all female collective born in Cuba that sources and curates crypto art & culture. We believe in equal opportunities and representation for all genders, and therefore we focus on featuring women artists, trans artists and artists from other minorities. As we seek to curate quality art NFTs exhibitions, we advocate their proliferation within the metaverse. To bring forward a project with certain values and curate exhibitions in the metaverse is to curate the metaverse: our future.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash stemmed from the intention to balance out genders&apos; representation in the crypto realm and from the urgency to bring to it sound curatorship and intellectual thinking.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash was founded in March 2021 by the art historians and curators Luisa Ausenda (Italian-American, based between Miami, Havana and Milan) and Gladys Garrote (Cuban, based in Havana). Both had been working for over a year as curators for the art NFTs platform Snark.art and as advisors to other platforms, collectors and artists.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Both are considered to be two of the initiators of the crypto art movement in Cuba, where internet access is still scarce, and so is access to crypto currencies and platforms. Not only did they discover a way to navigate the system albeit being in Cuba, but they also spread the word and supported numerous artists in approaching the ecosystem, thus yielding a true Digital Revolution.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Later in 2021, Federica Pogliani joined the team thus adding her expertise and art critic in Digital Strategy to it.
