        <h2 className={styles.displayhead}>Our Story</h2>
        <div className={styles.content}>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash is an all female collective born in Cuba that sources and curates crypto art & culture. We believe in equal opportunities and representation for all genders, and therefore we focus on featuring women artists, trans artists and artists from other minorities. As we seek to curate quality art NFTs exhibitions, we advocate their proliferation within the metaverse. To bring forward a project with certain values and curate exhibitions in the metaverse is to curate the metaverse: our future.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash stemmed from the intention to balance out genders&apos; representation in the crypto realm and from the urgency to bring to it sound curatorship and intellectual thinking.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            ClitSplash was founded in March 2021 by the art historians and curators Luisa Ausenda (Italian-American, based between Miami, Havana and Milan) and Gladys Garrote (Cuban, based in Havana). Both had been working for over a year as curators for the art NFTs platform Snark.art and as advisors to other platforms, collectors and artists.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Both are considered to be two of the initiators of the crypto art movement in Cuba, where internet access is still scarce, and so is access to crypto currencies and platforms. Not only did they discover a way to navigate the system albeit being in Cuba, but they also spread the word and supported numerous artists in approaching the ecosystem, thus yielding a true Digital Revolution.
            </p>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Later in 2021, Federica Pogliani joined the team thus adding her expertise and art critic in Digital Strategy to it.

            <p className={styles.body}>Co-founder of ClitSplash, Gladys Garrote (Havana, Cuba) is a curator, art writer and art historian working with NFTs and the metaverse. Since 2014, she is Professor at Havana University, where she teaches Art Appreciation, Contemporary Art Market and Art History courses. She holds a Master degree in Art History with a focus on the Contemporary art&apos;s market. Garrote collaborated in the organization of numerous Cuban and international artists&apos; exhibitions, both curating and promoting, and managing them. Topics such as feminism, cultural memory, the rewriting of history, collective identities and self-reflection are often tackled by Garrote in her essays and critical texts. Among her main achievements within the NFTs space, we may mention her contribution to ‘The Infinite Machine Movie&apos; collection. In this project, Garrote coordinated 36 international artists in charge of creating the artworks for the collection that will be implemented to finance the first feature film about the founding of Ethereum Blockchain. In 2021, she was selected as one of the curators of the major ‘NFT Liverpool&apos; event alongside noticeably influential figures within the NFTs space. Recently, she was nominated as one of 22 women in NFTs to watch in 2022 by Redlion news, an e-magazine specializing in crypto art.</p>
